Shane Dela Rosa is an RMIT University student who is majoring in creative writing for her Bachelor of Arts degree. She writes poetry that is comparatively "acceptable" and miserable fiction. She does, however, prefers more to write poetry and uses the five senses as a beginning point for her works. This enables her to use her imagination and venture outside of "the box" to provide engaging content for her readers. Of course, she would prefer to dream than to compose stories the way a writer ought to. Also, she has a ginger cat named Tamago who suffers from her nightly gossip.
