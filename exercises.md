**WEEK 1**

**What is digital writing?**
-  Writing with additional media (music, images) to make it more visually pleasing to attract
- Easier access due to technology development

Hypertext to project the web (intercorrelation into something)
 
 
**What do I expect from the digital writing?**
- To be able to learn more about the progress and ways of making digital works using the tools I am unfamiliar with (techniques)
- I can create something I cant imagine being able to do as of the moment (make something out of convention mayhap)


**What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?**
 - Poetry

**What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?**
 - I used to write in notebooks but now I just use notes (app) and post it notes with either images I took or links to music. At the end of each poem, I usually write what made me write the poem with simple statements such as I saw a funny scene while walking etc. (the poem usually is based on emotion / feelings)
- The techniques I use almost all the time when I am writing poetry are the five senses. I base it off the emotions that relates to any (or all) of the senses.
 
**Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?**
 - A starting point. For me, its more of reflecting on my poetries. I like going back to them and trying to remember why I got to that point or why I wrote the specific poem.
 - A guide to how to start sort of.
 
**How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?**
- The technique I use, I think helps me formulate how I will start my poem. Deriving from there and going off tangent or going outside the box as I'd like to call it. It's like a starting point or guide in how I write.
- Writing this way definitely allows me to explore emotions correlating on how human experiences the senses, almost very relatable to everyone if experiencing the same thing.

**WEEK 2**

THE DADAIST POEM

**WEEK 3**

N+7

Replace every noun in a short piece of writing with the seventh noun that is found after it in a dictionary.

Winter (page 24)
Original:

With little money in a great city.

There's snow in every street
Where I go up and down, 
And there's no woman, man or dog
That knows me in the town.

I know each shop, and all 
These Jews, and Russian Poles
For I go walking night and noon
To spare my sack of coals. 

Result:

With little _mongan_ in a great _civilian_.

There's _snowcap_ in every _strengthen_
Where I go up and down, 
And there's no _wombat_, _manager_ or _dogger_
That knows me in the _towpath_.

I know each _shopping_, and all 
These _jewellers_, and _Russophile polemic_
For I go walking _nightie_ and _noontide_
To spare my _sack suit_ of _coaming_. 

- It doesn't make sense at all but the whole activity was interesting and fun. The downside of this activity, however, is not having a physical dictionary as it doesn't work well with online dictionary. 

**START OF TWINE EXPERIMENT** - FOR FINAL WORK

**ONE**

The start of Week 5 is the introduction to the idea of hypertext and hypertext fiction. 
![IMG_1408](https://github.com/shane-dr/digitial-writing-folio/assets/163132499/6996d454-ccd9-48b6-a2b5-2c3aab521f89)

With more experiments and mind mapping, I ultimately ended up pursuing the story of 'Who murdered my fianc√©?' as my first twine story.

**TWO**

Introduced to Bitsy as another option for our big folio.

**THREE**

Was the start of solely focusing on Twine for the final project.

Mind mapping and brainstorming intensified to finalise the story. 

**FOUR**

With the experimentation, I mostly struggled with the sizes of the images I intend to add and find the right audio and makit it work. This includes texts in the right side or if I wanted it in the centre.

Branching off my proposal, by this time I have encountered more problems in Twine which I ultimately able to fix. I was also able to ad more things for my tags in the style sheets during this period. 

**SIX**

From the plan of my narrative, I proposed to have roughly around 8 characters to be introduced. Going forward with the texts, I realised that I don't need that much characters, and moving with this much character can potentially lengethen the narrative. So, I decided to leave it with five characters excluding the MC. 

**SEVEN**

Going further with my narrative, I decided to take off the 'backward button' from it. This takes out the "maze-like" feel from what I mentioned in my proposal. This is because I now wanted to have the audience follow one path and one flow while going through the narrative and I realised that having the button can create massive confusion and may be forced to be redirected to somehwere they didnt need to be. 

**EIGHT**

In this section, I tried to add time in the text for the first part of the narrative to add timing and pace to the readers. However, some of the codes were not right which took awhile to figure out what was wrong.

**NINE**

I have finished finalising the picture map where all rooms lead back again to the main house where readers can decide to move forward with the story.

**TEN**

With the main story finalised, adding them to twine while adding images, background colour and audio became easy. Though a few things were changed and differs from the proposal, like having the eye to each passages became quite redundant so I left the poetry part to 'the house' and made that the poetry part of the story aside from the first three options for characters which all has 'the eye'. The main big change of this project was the ending. Having different or one ending was the one I was unsure of until the end. And I realised, that adding an extra passage can make the narrative longer than it already is. So, with this, I ended up with this narrative as the 'part 1' and ended it with a cliffhanger that just leads the readers back to the main first passage. 

Personally, reading and going through this myself made me realise how fast paced the story went but at the same time was dragged. So, with the ending I ended up with was not satisfying but it was the safest choice I had with the limited time I was given. In the future, I would definitely would want to work on this further to give this a proper ending and better execution than what I have.
