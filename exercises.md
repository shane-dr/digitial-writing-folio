**WEEK 1**

**What is digital writing?**
-  Writing with additional media (music, images) to make it more visually pleasing to attract
- Easier access due to technology development

Hypertext to project the web (intercorrelation into something)
 
 
**What do I expect from the digital writing?**
- To be able to learn more about the progress and ways of making digital works using the tools I am unfamiliar with (techniques)
- I can create something I cant imagine being able to do as of the moment (make something out of convention mayhap)


**What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?**
 - Poetry

**What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?**
 - I used to write in notebooks but now I just use notes (app) and post it notes with either images I took or links to music. At the end of each poem, I usually write what made me write the poem with simple statements such as I saw a funny scene while walking etc. (the poem usually is based on emotion / feelings)
- The techniques I use almost all the time when I am writing poetry are the five senses. I base it off the emotions that relates to any (or all) of the senses.
 
**Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?**
 - A starting point. For me, its more of reflecting on my poetries. I like going back to them and trying to remember why I got to that point or why I wrote the specific poem.
 - A guide to how to start sort of.
 
**How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?**
- The technique I use, I think helps me formulate how I will start my poem. Deriving from there and going off tangent or going outside the box as I'd like to call it. It's like a starting point or guide in how I write.
- Writing this way definitely allows me to explore emotions correlating on how human experiences the senses, almost very relatable to everyone if experiencing the same thing.

**WEEK 2**

THE DADAIST POEM

**WEEK 3**

N+7

Replace every noun in a short piece of writing with the seventh noun that is found after it in a dictionary.

Winter (page 24)
Original:

With little money in a great city.

There's snow in every street
Where I go up and down, 
And there's no woman, man or dog
That knows me in the town.

I know each shop, and all 
These Jews, and Russian Poles
For I go walking night and noon
To spare my sack of coals. 

Result:

With little _mongan_ in a great _civilian_.

There's _snowcap_ in every _strengthen_
Where I go up and down, 
And there's no _wombat_, _manager_ or _dogger_
That knows me in the _towpath_.

I know each _shopping_, and all 
These _jewellers_, and _Russophile polemic_
For I go walking _nightie_ and _noontide_
To spare my _sack suit_ of _coaming_. 

- It doesn't make sense at all but the whole activity was interesting and fun. The downside of this activity, however, is not having a physical dictionary as it doesn't work well with online dictionary. 

**START OF TWINE EXPERIMENT** - FOR FINAL WORK

**ONE**

The start of Week 5 is the introduction to the idea of hypertext and hypertext fiction.

With more experiments and mind mapping, I ultimately ended up pursuing the story of 'Who murdered my fianc√©?' as my first twine story.
